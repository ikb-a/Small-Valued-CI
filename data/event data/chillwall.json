         "description":"Upmanship: Enhancing The Science of CSR Toronto  How and Now success in CSR depends on \"upping\" performance. It requires understanding the value and values in asking the right questions as well as applying knowledge-based answers. Evidence exists that responsibility can be designed and delivered. We're offering five days worth of unique exposure to tools and strategies that can best create value, realize returns, and enhance rewards by design. These presentations, panels and workshops allow corporations to \"up\" their reputation and demonstrate that they are leading in corporate responsibility. The proceedings will provide answers about how best to face external demands such as \"giving back\", transparency, probity, and accountability. Participate in formulating and assessing strategies that can meet calls for responsibility coming from staff, investors, clients, host communities, supply chain partners, and regulators. Hear first-hand about evidence-based techniques that will best empower staff to take pride in their jobs, contribute to social goals, and enhance a company's reputation. Ask questions about what tools – how and now-- will allow management to create value, reduce risk, enhance profitability, and demonstrate leadership. This four day course explores dozens of vital Now and How answers to these questions. Participates will debate, share insight into, and discuss relevant knowledge about three major challenges: 1.

Time: 12pm-1pm, Pizza lunch will be provided to seminar registrants  Place: PGCRL, Event room 3a/b  Research in the field of epigenetics has grown at a rapid pace since the discovery of the first histone acetyltransferase enzymes 19 years ago.  Since then, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of epigenetics (histone acetylation, histone methylation, chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation) and the impact of epigenetic deregulation on cancer, inflammation, metabolism, and neurological diseases.  This impact on disease has been underscored by the recent identification of potential oncogenic driver mutations in histone H3.3, and the histone methyltransferases EZH2 and WHSC1.  The chromatin IP (ChIP) assay is a widely used application and has provided a wealth of information regarding the localization and abundance of epigenetic marks and DNA-binding proteins across the genome in many cell types and tissues.  I will present on important factors to consider when performing the ChIP assay, including the use of highly validated antibodies, optimized protocols and reagents, and the advantages of using enzyme-based chromatin digestion over sonication-based chromatin fragmentation.

         "description":"An Economic Literacy Project (ELP) for the Environmental Community: Helping to Build a Smarter and Sustainable Economy   The Economic Literacy Project (ELP) centres on training and knowledge building that supports the development of a smarter and sustainable economy.  The training program consists of a series of six, ½ day training workshops this spring at the Centre for Social Innovation – Spadina in Toronto that will build ENGO capacity by increasing knowledge and understanding of economic concepts and their role in supporting a green economy. This combination of classroom training, information sharing and convening is designed to provide a pulse of capacity building to environmental leaders and affiliated partners and allies. The training stream takes a case-based approach to address key economic concepts, their assumptions, key measures and gaps, and their strengths and limitations.   Session #1 April 7 Assessing the Promise and Perils of Markets - Anticipate when economic markets are more likely to work or fail the environment and how markets compare to other ways of managing human interactions.    Session #2 April 21 Valuing the Priced and Unpriced Environment – How to value environmental gains and losses, using prices and non-price measures of value, so that people can be better informed about environmental and social scarcities.    Session #3 May 5 Rewarding Pro-Environmental Behaviour – How economists understand humans, and how pro-environmental behaviour can be purposefully or perversely affected, as humans act in an environmental context.    Session #4 May 19 Reconciling Trade-Offs for Better Decisions – Economic tools and strategies that can inform public decisions that involve contested gains and losses, over space and time, within and outside of the marketplace.    Session #5 June 2 Redefining Economic Progress and Sustainability – What is included, and omitted, by old and new measures of the economy, and how different forms of natural and human-created wealth relate to each other and the measurement of sustainability.    Session #6 June 16 Reorienting the Economy for the 21st Century – How ecological economic models can inform the pathways to desirable futures and strategies to manage risks and uncertainties and other unknowns.   All sessions take place on Tuesday afternoons from 1:00 – 4:30 at the Centre for Social Innovation – Spadina (CSI-Spadina) in Toronto.  The instructor of the program is Eric Miller, a consulting ecological economist and contract faculty at York University. He has experience serving the Ontario and Federal governments as a public servant and has helped hundreds of students through his teaching of undergraduate and graduate students at York University and Queen’s University. Eric earned economic degrees from York University and McMaster and a biology degree from Carleton. He is an active member of Canadian Society for Ecological Economics.    Registration for the series is only $250 per person as the Economic Literacy Project is supported by a grant from the Ivey Foundation. Space is limited.",

         "description":"After too much time freelance writing and watching re-runs in a windowless Brooklyn basement, guitarist and songwriter Sadie Dupuis left New York City for the wilds of Northampton, MA in order to pursue a master's degree in poetry. In doing so, she began Speedy Ortiz, a self-recorded lo-fi project named after a minor character from the Love and Rockets comic series. Speedy Ortiz soon became something else entirely as bassist Darl Ferm, guitarist Matt Robidoux, and drummer Mike Falcone teamed up to form a full band, balancing abrasive noise with infectious earworms. The newly minted Speedy Ortiz quickly found an audience in the Boston DIY scene, playing frequently with their friends Pile, Grass is Green, Fat History Month, Sneeze, Krill, and Arvid Noe.  Almost immediately, the band recorded a two-song single, \"Taylor Swift\" and \"Swim Fan,\" with Paul Q. Kolderie (Pixies, Hole) and Justin Pizzoferrato (Chelsea Light Moving, Dinosaur Jr.), and self-released it in March of 2012. Shortly thereafter they spent a few weekends at the dingy yet atmospheric Sex Dungeon Studios in Philadelphia recording the Sports EP, a five-track, loosely conceptual 10\" released that June on Exploding in Sound Records.  The creation of Major Arcana, their full-length debut, marks the evolution of Speedy Ortiz into a wholly collaborative effort. Darl leans toward basic, chunky parts, while Mike, a talented songwriter in his own right, helped arrange while also providing aggressive, boisterous drums. And Matt is a classically trained guitarist, but his experience in noise and experimental music comes through in his anti-melodic guitar solos, which counterbalance Sadie's angular, scalar guitar riffs and poppy vocals.  The end result is a band able to distill their influences and creative impulses into something at once dissonant and melodic, noisy yet undeniably pop.

         "description":"Python is an open sourced and extremely useful programming language that has countless applications in both research and industry.  This workshops series consists of four sessions each one building on the knowledge and experience of its predecessors.   Each session is taught in person by a professional Python programmer and all code will be distributed for later reuse.  You will learn with real examples and by coding up solutions to small problems yourself with one-on-one guidance and advice.  By the end of these workshops, you will be comfortable with: - coding in Python - working with data including analysis and visualization - automating tedious tasks using scripts - producing robust code using proper coding patterns, version control, and regression testing Workshop Details The workshop spans 4 sessions of 3 hours each.  Each session consists of a 2 hour learning program followed by a 1 hour interactive coding exercise.  Each workshop runs from 9am - 12pm. Session 1 This first session will get you familiar with working with Python as a programming language.  You will be introduced on how to get yourself coding using the powerful PythonXY development package.  You will be shown how to install and use the Spyder Development Environment, which is intended to be the easiest way to work with scientific data using Python. The basics of the language will be demonstrated.  This includes an introduction to all simple Python objects and their important methods.  Basic program flow and logic will be shown. Session 2 The second session will finish off the language basics, an introduction to some crucial built-in packages, covering some more advanced topics like working with files, creating scripts, working with time and dates. Session 3 The fundamentals of working with data in Python using the `numpy` package will be covered as well as how to take your data and visualize it in a myriad of ways using the `matplotlib` package.  Graphs will be made, modified, and saved to the local hard drive.  Use of advanced scientific algorithms such as fast fourier transforms will be explored with the `scipy` package. Session 4 Some best practices for coding such as version control will be introduced as well as some more refined project habits like unit testing.",
