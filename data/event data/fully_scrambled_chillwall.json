It requires understanding the value and values in asking the right questions as well as applying knowledge-based answers. Evidence exists that responsibility can be designed and delivered. We\u0027re offering five days worth of unique exposure to tools and strategies that can best create value, realize returns, and enhance rewards by design. These presentations, panels and workshops allow corporations to \"up\" their reputation and demonstrate that they are leading in corporate responsibility. The proceedings will provide answers about how best to face external demands such as \"giving back\", transparency, probity, and accountability. Participate in formulating and assessing strategies that can meet calls for responsibility coming from staff, investors, clients, host communities, supply chain partners, and regulators. Hear first-hand about evidence-based techniques that will best empower staff to take pride in their jobs, contribute to social goals, and enhance a company\u0027s reputation. Ask questions about what tools – how and now-- will allow management to create value, reduce risk, enhance profitability, and demonstrate leadership. This four day course explores dozens of vital Now and How answers to these questions. Participates will debate, share insight into, and discuss relevant knowledge about three major challenges: 1.
